        iOS Recipes begins with a tour of UIKit. Former Apple Evangelist Matt Drance and expert graphical-systems programmer Paul Warren show you how to write splash screens and embedded web browsers that are easily dropped into any project. You'll explore techniques for building complex table views without losing yourself in a sea of code, and see how to add some unique visual touches to any table--even the ones you've already built.

Next you'll explore Quartz and Core Animation, and you'll walk through a number of fills, transforms, and animations that will breathe life into any app or game. You'll also learn about gestures, transitions, and custom controls to take your user interactions to the next level. 

You'll tackle networking with a few basic techniques to prevent unnecessary repetition in your codebases, and address some more complex problems like uploading large files to a web server. Finally, you'll see some simple disciplines and ideas that will make architecting, debugging, maintaining, and ultimately shipping your application easier every single time.

By the end of this book, you'll have expanded your iPhone and iPad development knowledge and be well on your way to building elegant solutions that are ready for whatever project you take on next.
